    * Added random subspace technique, implemented in RandomSubspace.
    * Separated functionality from LinearFunction into IdentityScalarFunction.
      LinearFunction by default is the same, but has parameters that can change
      the slope and offset of the function.
    * Default squashing function for GeneralizedLinearModel and 
      DifferentiableGeneralizedLinearModel is now a linear function instead of 
      an atan function.
    * Added a weighted estimator for the Poisson distribution.
    * Added Regressor interface for evaluators that are the output of 
      (single-output) regression learning algorithms. Existing such evaluators

    * Added checkedAdd and checkedMultiply functions to MathUtil, providing a 
      means for conducting Integer addition and multiplication with explicit
      checking for overflow and underflow, and throwing an ArithmeticException
      if they occur.  Java fails silently in integer over(under)flow situations.
    * Added explicit integer overflow checks to DenseMatrix.  The underlying MTJ
      library stores dense matrices as a single dimensional arrays of integers, 
      which in Java are 32-bit.  When creating a matrix with numRows rows and 
      numColumns columns, if numRows * numColumns is more than 2^31 - 1, a 
      silent integer overflow would occur, resulting in later 
      ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions when attempting to access matrix elements 
      that didn't get allocated.

      matrices together and for inverting a DiagonalMatrix.

      matrices unnecessarily and to reduce computation time using improved
      DiagonalMatrix interfaces.
    * Added regularization and explicit bias estimation to 
      MultivariateLinearRegression.
    * Added ConvexReceiverOperatingCharacteristic, which computes the convex
      hull of the ROC.

      optional trapezoidal AUC computation.

      added publication references.

    * Added AbstractVectorSpace, which provides an abstract, partial 
      implementation of the VectorSpace interface.
    * Updated Vector, AbstractVector, VectorEntry to build on new VectorSpace 
      interface and AbstractVectorSpace class.

      of indices, but contains only a countable number in any given instance.
    * Added DefaultInfiniteVector, an implementation of the InfiniteVector
      interface backed by a LinkedHashMap.

      fixed-size array to minimize memory allocation.

      depth.

      for decision tree algorithm.

      information gain calculation.
    * Updated SequentialMinimalOptimization to improve speed.
    * Added LinearBasisRegression, which uses a basis function to generate
      vectors before performing a LinearRegression.
    * Added MultivariateLinearRegression, which performs multivariate regression;
      does not explicitly estimate a bias term or perform regularization.
    * Added LinearDiscriminantWithBias, which provides a LinearDiscriminant with
      an additional bias term that gets added to the output of the dot product.
    * Updated LinearRegression and LogisticRegression to provide for bias term 
      estimation and use of L2 regularization.
    * Renamed SquashedMatrixMultiplyVectorFunction to GeneralizedLinearModel.
    * Renamed DifferentiableSquashedMatrixMultiplyVectorFunction to
      DifferentiableGeneralizedLinearModel.

      package.
  * Text Core:
    * Renamed LatentDirichetAllocationVectorGibbsSampler to
      LatentDirichletAllocationVectorGibbsSampler to fix misspelling.

      version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

      learning.perceptron.kernel package.
    * Added KernelUtil utility class for dealing with kernels and kernel
      binary categorizers.
    * Refactored statistics to remove getMean() from Distribution due to
      some distributions not having a meaningful mean and confusion for what
      the mean meant in some classes.
    * Classes and interfaces interfaces named *Scalar* renamed to *Univariate*
      for clarity.
    * Added getTestStatistic() method to ConfidenceStatistic interface and
      implemented in existing classes.

     another learn method that takes an Iterable.
     AbstractBatchAndIncrementalLearner now implements it.
   * Added SupervisedIncrementalLearner interface, supervised version,
     SupervisedBatchAndIncrementalLearner, and abstract class
     AbstractSupervisedBatchAndIncrementalLearner. Many incremental learning

     algorithm.

     IncrementalClusterCreator interface.
   * BinaryBaggingLearner: Generalized generics in constructor.

   * VectorFactoryContainer is now an interface, existing implementation moved
     to DefaultVectorFactoryContainer.

     AbstractBatchLearnerWrapper to AbstractBatchLearnerContainer
   * Added DiscriminantCategorizer and BinaryDiscriminantCategorizer interfaces.
     Almost all Categorizers now implement one of these interfaces; some

   * ThresholdBinaryCategorizer is now an interface. Existing implementation
     moved to ScalarThresholdBinaryCategorizer.
   * AbstractThresholdBinaryCategorizer now longer contains the threshold
     directly, instead it assumes the threshold is applied in evaluateAsDouble
     and categorizes based on zero. This is to remove the confusion of having
     both a bias and a threshold in some classes and to clarify the meaning of
     evaluateAsDouble so that it matches the new BinaryDiscriminantCategorizer
     interface.
   * DataHistogram: Added isEmpty method and implemented in
     AbstractDataHistogram.
   * Made new ConfusionMatrix and BinaryConfusionMatrix interfaces and put them
     in the gov.sandia.cognition.learning.performance.categorization. Refactored
     existing confusion matrix code to implement these interfaces; the existing
     class ending up in DefaultBinaryConfusionMatrix. New confusion matrix
     interface uses generics to be useful for more than just binary
     categorization.
   * Now uses JUnit 4.6 for tests.

  * ParallelDirichletProcessMixtureModel: Performance improvements.
  * MultivariateGaussianMeanBayesianEstimator: Update now optimized for case of
    a list instead of a single update.
  * MultivariateGaussianMeanCovarianceBayesianEstimator: Optimizations for case
    of providing a list of data.
  * BetaBinomialDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * BetaDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * ChineseRestaurantProcess: Now keeps track of total customers.
  * ExponentialDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * GammaDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * GeometricDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * LaplaceDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * MultinomialDistribution: Added logSize method.
  * MultivariateGaussian: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * NegativeBinomialDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * NormalInverseWishartDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * PoissonDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * ScalarDataDistribution: getDomain now returns in sorted order.
  * StudentTDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * UniformDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * UnivariateGaussian: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * ConfidenceIntervalEvaluator: Added computeConfidenceInterval method that
    takes a mean, variance, number of samples, and confidence. All existing
    ConfidenceIntervalEvaluators updated; which mostly meant changing static
    methods to be member methods and adding INSTANCE variables for those without
    parameters.
  * ChebyshevInequality: Now extends AbstractCloneableSerializable.
