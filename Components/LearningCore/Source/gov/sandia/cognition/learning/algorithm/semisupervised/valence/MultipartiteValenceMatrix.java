/**
 * This class implements a semi-supervised learning algorithm for spreading
 * "valence" across a multi-partite graph. First some definitions: Valence is
 * any spectrum with two distinguishable sides; a multipartite graph is a graph
 * that can be separated into different groups where each group can link to any
 * node in other groups, but does not link to any nodes within his own group.
 *
 * The simplest use for this algorithm is the one it was originally proposed
 * for: Semi-supervised document and term tagging for sentiment analysis. Given
 * a set of n documents, create a graph based on the document/term matrix. There
 * are n document nodes that refer to a term node for each term in that
 * document. Thus each document will point to many term nodes and most term
 * nodes will be referred to by several document nodes. If you then supply a
 * small set of initial weights (+1/-1) for any "happy" or "sad" terms and/or
 * documents and let this algorithm run, the influence of the marked terms will
 * spread to their neighboring documents, the influence of marked documents will
 * spread to their neighboring terms. The power passed into the constructor
 * correlates to the distance that influence spreads.
 *
 * However, this implementation is more generic than that description.
 * Specifically, it supports any multi-partition graph with any set of nodes
 * labeled and then spreading to the rest. In fact, if you want it to be any
 * generic graph, this can be done by creating a graph with as many partitions
 * as there are nodes (yes, a bit clumsy). This last case has not been tested
 * explicitly, but we have examined the math this is based on and have not found
 * any assumptions requiring proper partitions.
 *
 * This code has been tested on many different scale problems including 100s of
 * documents with 10,000s terms (seconds to run) up to a low-connectivity
 * 5-partition graph of ~500,000,000 nodes (1.2 average degree; ~6 days to run).
