/**
 * The {@code AbstractAnytimeBatchLearner} abstract class 
 * implements a standard method for conforming to the {@code BatchLearner} and
 * {@code AnytimeLearner} ({@code IterativeAlgorithm} and 
 * {@code StoppableAlgorithm}) interfaces. In doing so it implements 
 * the logic to handle the events that are fired for IterativeLearner and the 
 * method calls required for {@code StoppableAlgorithm} inside of the learn 
 * method for the {@code BatchLearner} interface. This means that classes that 
 * extend this abstract class can focus on the implementation of the logic of 
 * the learning algorithm and get conformance to these useful interfaces without 
 * any real effort.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Classes that extend this class must implement the following methods:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>{@code initializeLearning} - Initializes the learning algorithm.</LI>
 *     <LI>{@code step} - Performs a single step of the learning algorithm.</LI>
 *     <LI>{@code cleanupLearning} - Clean up after learning has been completed.</LI>
 *     <LI>{@code getResult} - Get the result of learning.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <BR><BR>
 * The general design pattern for this class that implementing classes should
 * follow is to store all of the main state information of the algorithm as
 * fields so that each of the different methods listed above will
 * modify the state of the algorithm.
 *
 * @param   <ResultType> The type of object created by the learning algorithm.
 *          For example, a {@code FeedforwardNeuralNetwork}.
 * @param   <DataType> The type of the data that the algorithm uses to perform
 *          the learning. For example, a 
 *          {@code Collection<InputOutputPair<Vector, Double>>} or 
 *          {@code String}.
