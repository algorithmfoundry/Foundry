/**
 * An extension of java.util.Random that builds a list of random doubles
 * and then serves up the random values from the array, returning to the beginning
 * when the end is reached.  This class 
 * 
 * Only nextDouble() will return these repeated sequences of random numbers.  All
 * other types should work according to the java.util.Random implementation.
 * 
 * This class can be helpful when a program is experiencing slowdown from 
 * frequently calling Random.nextDouble().  This class decreases the mathematical
 * purity of the random number sequence (as the sequence is reused).
 * 
 * Recommendations:
 * 1) make sure the length of the array is different from the number of iterations
 *    of other loops in the program.  This will help avoid situations where the same
 *    numbers are used in the same context of the loop.
 * 2) make the length of the array large enough to guarantee sufficient coverage
 *    of the random number sequence (an array of length 10 would likely have gaps
 *    in the range of numbers)
